# connectapi <img src='man/figures/logo.svg' align="right" height="139" />

This package is an **experimental WIP**. The package provides an R
client for the [RStudio Connect API](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/api/) as
well as helpful functions that utilize the client. The package is based on the
`rsconnnect` [package](https://rstudio.github.io/rsconnect/), but is publicly
exported to be easier to use, is extensible via an R6 class, and is separated
from the `rsconnect` package for easier support and maintenance.

## Installation

To get started:

```r
devtools::install_github('rstudio/connectapi')
```

## Client

To create a client:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(connectapi)
client <- connect(
  host = 'https://connect.example.com',
  api_key = '<SUPER SECRET API KEY>'
)
```

You can also define the following environment variables (in a `.Renviron` file, for instance):

```
RSTUDIO_CONNECT_SERVER  = https://connect.example.com
RSTUDIO_CONNECT_API_KEY = my-secret-api-key
```

These environment variable values will be used automatically if defined in your R session.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(connectapi)
client <- connect()
```

## Getting Started

Once a client is defined, you can use it to interact with RStudio Connect.

### Exploring Data

These are experimental `lazy_tbl`s that allow you to retrieve data from the
Connect Server API much like using `dplyr`, `dbplyr`, or `dtplyr`.  Use
`collect()` to retrieve data when finished.

NOTE: `filter` is not yet supported with this `tbl_connect` implementation.

```r
library(connectapi)
client <- connect()

users <- tbl_connect(client, "users")
groups <- tbl_connect(client, "groups")
shiny_usage <- tbl_connect(client, "shiny_usage")
content_visits <- tbl_connect(client, "content_visits")
all_content <- tbl_connect(client, "content")

all_shiny_usage <- shiny_usage %>% dplyr::collect()
```

### Deployment

The `rsconnect` package is usually used for deploying content to Connect.
However, if you want to use programmatic deployment with the RStudio Connect
Server API, then these `connectapi` helpers should be useful!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(connectapi)
client <- connect()

# deploying content

bundle <- bundle_dir("./path/to/directory")
content <- client %>% 
  deploy(bundle, name = "my-app-name") %>% 
  poll_task()

# set an image for content

content %>% 
  set_image_path("./my/local/image.png")

content %>% 
  set_image_url("http://url.example.com/image.png")

# set image and a vanity URL

content %>%
  set_image_path("./my/local/image.png") %>%
  set_vanity_url("/my-awesome-app")
  
# edit another piece of content

client %>%
  content_item("the-content-guid") %>%
  set_vanity_url("/another-awesome-app")
  
# migrate content to another server

client_prod <- connect(
  host = "prod.example.com",
  api_key = "my-secret-key"
)

prod_bnd <- client %>%
  content_item("the-guid-to-promote") %>%
  download_bundle()

client_prod %>%
  deploy(prod_bnd, title = "Now in Production") %>%
  set_vanity_url("/my-app")
```
